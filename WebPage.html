            <p>Welcome, everyone! Iâ€™m excited to share with you two unique rap songs that I've created to highlight the incredible benefits of EMDD and how it makes our work easier. EMDD, which stands for Entrepreneurship mindset using design and digital tools</p>
            <p>First, I'll play the English rap, which captures the essence of EMDD and its impact on our daily work. After that, I'll share the Hinglish rap, which combines English and Hindi to make the concept accessible and engaging for a broader audience. These songs are not just informative but also entertaining, aiming to simplify complex ideas and make them memorable."</p>
